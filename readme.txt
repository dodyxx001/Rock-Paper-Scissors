This is a project made entirely by myself, as a part of The Odin Project course.
The goals of this projects were:

 - for the first version: create a console-based five-round game, with no user UI,
   that prompts user for input, than randomly selects computer input,
   runs the MAIN game function which compares the inputs and returns
   (alerts) the user with results.
 - version 1 has only 1 round of the game functional.
 - version 2 has 5 rounds of game functional.

Next step was to create a user UI with buttons.
Clicking the buttons gets the user's input. Computer's input is generated randomly.
This is saved in version 3:

- User interface, made with HTML and CSS
- Animated buttons (with CSS and JS), which change on hover, and on click, they
  fetch the user's input.
- Animated display of results (animations done with CSS and JS - eventlisteners
  and keyframes).
- An animated field, which shows the win-text or lose-text, so the player gets the
  information if he won or lost the current round.
- A result-counter at the bottom of the page, which displays current score of 
  both players.
- A final-result window, which shows when one of the players reaches score of 3
- This window is positioned in center of the page and everything else is blurred, so 
  player cannot continue the game.
- A 'play again' button is added with 'reload page' function, so player can play 
  again.


This project was quite fun to make and quite challenging for a beginner! :)
Things I learned:
- Keeping the code organised, because it got long and I needed logic
- Writing a lot of comments
- JS and the DOM, targeting HTML elements, adding various eventlisteners
- Animations in CSS ( keyframes ).
- Adding and removing classes
- Timeout function and its use
- Creating and appending child html elements
- Blurring the background
- A little bit longer and complex functions:)
